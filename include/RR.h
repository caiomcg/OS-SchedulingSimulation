 *
 * @brief Round Robin algorithm simulation class
 *
 * This Class is responsible for receiving a std::vector of Processes
 * and run the RR algorithm over the input. The user can request the
 * average response time, the average return time and the average wait
 * time using getters or the toString method. 
 *
